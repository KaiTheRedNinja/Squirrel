# Squirrel*
**Pronounced: Scroll-Wheel*

A menu bar app that adds scrolling to the simulator.

- For some reason, you can't scroll in Xcode's simulator.
- This app enables scrolling again!
- Features: customizable settings, made with SwiftUI, and a cute squirrel.
- [Download](https://github.com/aheze/Squirrel/blob/main/Squirrel.zip) here.

### How does it work?

Squirrel uses your Mac's accessibility controls to simulate a "drag" gesture.

### Apple, if you're reading this:

Please add native scroll support to the Simulator! Feels like such a small feature but it'll be very welcome.
